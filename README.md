# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

Code repository while I read and study SICP.

Every code in here is an interpretation of the book based solely on my personal understanding about computer and programming. Therefore, it's highly suggested for you to not use these code in any production environment, and only treat it as a measly attempt from myself to tackle such a rich book about programming.
